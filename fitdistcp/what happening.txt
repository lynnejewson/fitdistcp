- GEV I will do last, in the hope that I can iron out the issues using my contours for 2D

GAMMA:
Troubling.
R's RUST returns different values depending on the value of rotate.
rotate = TRUE: slightly different to mine
rotate = FALSE: same as mine
The difference is largest for dataset 1.
The odd thing is that my calculated rotation is the identity.
Ask Paul about this.
For now, I am going to assume that my gammas are correct.


checklist
expon - Yes.
norm - Yes, except dataset 2 which has very small variance (mine crashes.) Check this again.
lnorm - Yes
gamma - disturbing things happening with the R version. may work for me.
gumbel - Yes
weibull - yes (works as long as the maximum is found, which is not always. I am hard-coding ics=[1,1] for weibull, because this seems to work.)
genpareto - yes
genextreme: yes

double-checklist
gamma

then what?
- I figured that I could test that my values are correct for gamma by creating larger and larger samples but fmax starts failing
- presumably as the numerical value is very small
- perhaps fix by taking logf instead, as Paul does
