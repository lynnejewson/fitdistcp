gev conclusions

- can analyse the revdbayes? package for gev and gpd stuff
- understand the region in which gev=0, and so the invalid parameter space
- then look into what this stuff is: the 3 different methods for finding parameters, the cases in which these apply, and standard errors

questions:
- I assumed there was an analytic expression for the MLEs of the GEV but it comes down to just maximising the f.
- Is there a reason this is easier than maximising the posterior? the posterior is just 1/ sh * sc.
- Because it is indeed easier and it works where the posterior doesn't work.


what now???????
things that could be done
- a general investigation into speeding up the code
    Either caching or numba jit compiling could speed stuff up, but it doesn't seem that easy with my functions.
- check very thoroughly for errors
- improve my ICS for each distribution
- implement pwm for each distribution
- box-cox for all regions
- introduce user-defined transformations and implement with the GEV (SEs)

- c++ code
